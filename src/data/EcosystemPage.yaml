  - orgName: MLJ.jl
    orgLink: https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJ.jl
    orgMarkdownDesc: |
      MLJ.jl is the general user's point-of-entry for choosing, loading,
      composing, evaluating and tuning machine learning models.
      It pulls in most code from other repositories described below.
      MLJ also hosts the MLJ manual which documents functionality across the repositories,
      although some pages point to documentation hosted locally by a particular package.
    orthogonal: false

  - orgName: MLJModelInterface.jl
    orgLink: https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModelInterface.jl
    orgMarkdownDesc: |
      MLJModelInterface.jl is a lightweight package imported by packages
      implementing MLJ's interface for their machine learning models.
      It depends on ScientificTypesBase.jl and
      StatisticalTraits.jl (which depends only on ScientificTypesBase.jl).
    orthogonal: false

  - orgName: MLJBase.jl
    orgLink: https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJBase.jl
    orgMarkdownDesc: |
      MLJBase.jl is a large repository with two main purposes:
      (i) to give "dummy" methods defined in MLJModelInterface their intended functionality (which depends on third party packages,
      such as Tables.jl, Distributions.jl and CategoricalArrays.jl; and
      (ii) provide functionality essential to the MLJ user that has not been relegated to its own
      "satellite" repository for some reason.
      See the MLJBase.jl README.md for a detailed description of MLJBase's contents.

    orgLink: https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModels.jl
    orgMarkdownDesc: |
      MLJModels.jl hosts the MLJ model registry,
      which contains metadata on all the models the MLJ user can search and load from MLJ. Moreover,
      it provides the functionality for loading model code from MLJ on demand. Finally, it furnishes some
      commonly used transformers for data pre-processing, such as ContinuousEncoder and Standardizer.
