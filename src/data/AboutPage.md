# About MLJ
<div class="md-block-cont-big">
<p>
MLJ (Machine Learning in Julia) is a toolbox written in Julia providing a common interface
and meta-algorithms for selecting, tuning, evaluating, composing and comparing over 200
machine learning models. The toolbox integrates model algorithms written in both Julia and
other languages, spread across dozens of individual Julia packages. 
<br>
MLJ is an open source
project, copyrighted under the MIT "Expat" License.

<br>

The development and maintenance of MLJ is the primary concern of the MLJ Project, which
began as a Tools, Practices and Systems project at the [Alan Turing
Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) in 2019. Other significant sources of funding have
included the [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com) corporation, a [New Zealand Strategic Science
Investment
Fund](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/funding-information-and-opportunities/investment-funds/strategic-science-investment-fund/ssif-funded-programmes/university-of-auckland/)
awarded to the University of Auckland, and [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/en/web) (German
Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence).

## Guiding principles
<div class="md-block-cont-float">
<p>
The MLJ project aims to create high quality software that is **fast**, **scalable**, and
**reliable**, with a low maintenance burden. High **usability**, **transparency** and
**reproducibility** are particularly important goals for The Project. Because our solution
is Julia-based, these goals are readily achieved without compromising performance.

<br>

A core MLJ design principle is to facilitate **flexible composition** of models and
meta-algorithms, such as tuning, beyond the relatively constrained model pipelines of
existing toolboxes.
<br>
Project priorities are somewhat fluid. As an open software project, we rely considerably
on the contribution of volunteers, and the project tends to support the priorities of such
contributors.  On the other hand, significant offers of financial support will influence
future priorities.

## Founding contributors
<div class="md-block-cont-float">
<p>
Many dozens of volunteers have contributed, and continue to contribute to the MLJ
Project. Significant contributors in the Project's genesis were:

- **Core design:** Anthony Blaom, Franz Kir√°ly, Sebastian Vollmer
- **Development:** Anthony Blaom, Thibaut Lienart, Yiannis Simillides, Diego Arenas
