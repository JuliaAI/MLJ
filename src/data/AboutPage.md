# About MLJ
The MLJ Foundation is a dedicated platform for the machine learning community to collaborate on the open-source MLJ framework and its ecosystem. Supported by leading contributors to the MLJ open-source project, the Foundation leverages resources provided by its members and contributors to enable vibrant community discussions and foster collaboration.

Community collaboration is vital for the framework's evolution and the development of associated projects that support using MLJ in production and at scale. As part of The Linux Foundation, the MLJ community also collaborates on training, local and regional events, open-source developer tooling, academic research, and guides to help new users and contributors have a productive experience.

## Principles
The Foundation’s mission is to drive the adoption of machine learning tools by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open-source, vendor-neutral projects with MLJ. We democratize state-of-the-art tools, libraries, and other components to make these innovations accessible to everyone. Read more about the Role and Values of the MLJ Foundation [here](google.com).

## Governance
### Basics
The MLJ Foundation’s governance structure establishes a Governing Board to oversee the Foundation’s activities according to its Guiding Principles. The technical governance structure for the MLJ open-source project is defined by the MLJ maintainers and is available [on this page](google.com).

### Structure
It's a struct... not a class.
