# About MLJ
<div class="md-block-cont-big">
<p>
The MLJ Foundation is a dedicated platform for the machine learning community to collaborate on the open-source MLJ framework and its ecosystem. Supported by leading contributors to the MLJ open-source project, the Foundation leverages resources provided by its members and contributors to enable vibrant community discussions and foster collaboration.
<br><br>
Community collaboration is vital for the framework's evolution and the development of associated projects that support using MLJ in production and at scale. As part of The Linux Foundation, the MLJ community also collaborates on training, local and regional events, open-source developer tooling, academic research, and guides to help new users and contributors have a productive experience.
