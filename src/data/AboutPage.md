# About MLJ
<div class="md-block-cont-big">
<p>
MLJ is an open source project, copyrighted under the MIT "Expat" License.
<br><br>
The development and maintenance of MLJ is the primary concern of the MLJ Project, which
began as a Tools, Practices and Systems project at the [Alan Turing
Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) in 2019. Other significant sources of funding have
included the [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com) corporation, a [New Zealand Strategic Science
Investment
Fund](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/funding-information-and-opportunities/investment-funds/strategic-science-investment-fund/ssif-funded-programmes/university-of-auckland/)
awarded to the University of Auckland, and [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/en/web) (German
Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence).

## Guiding principles
<div class="md-block-cont-float">
<p>
The MLJ project aims to create high quality software that is **fast**, **scalable**, and
**reliable**, with a low maintenance burden. Additionally, **usability**,
**transparency** and **reproducibility** are very important goals for The
Project. 
<br><br>
A core MLJ design principle is to facilitate **flexible composition** of models and
meta-algorithms, such as tuning, beyond the relatively constrained model pipelines of
existing toolboxes.
<br><br>
Project priorities are somewhat fluid. As an open software project, we rely considerably
on the contribution of volunteers, and the project tends to support the priorities of such
contributors. Signficant infusions of financial support also shape MLJ priorities.
