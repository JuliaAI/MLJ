# This is the hint that shows up below the search bar and any links are printed in prple
# If multiple hints are written then one is chosen randomly in each reload of the website
hints:
  - Looking for a sequential progression of tutorials? See
   [DataScienceTutorials.jl](https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/)
  - A pro transitioning to Julia? Try [MLJ for Data Scientists in Two Hours](https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/end-to-end/telco/).
  - New to ML? Try [Vectors, Matrices and Data Loading in Julia](https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/isl/lab-2/).
  - Looking for a gentle intro to ML basics? Start with [Loading and Accessing Data](https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/data/loading/).

# Hints rotate with refresh anyway. This specifies how many seconds to wait before switching to the next hint (without a refresh).

# This is the placeholder for the search bar
searchText: Search over all tutorials


# These are the tutorial tags printed below the hint.
## The navigation file in DataScienceTutorials (or external tutorials) should use only these tags
## If they introduce new tags, then these should be added here and everything will work as expected
# This also controls the order of the tags (and tutorial blocks)
tags:
  - Data Processing
  - Classification
  - Regression
  - Clustering
  - Dimensionality Reduction
  - Neural Networks
  - Class Imbalance
  - Missing Value Imputation
  - Encoders
  - Feature Engineering
  - Hyperparameter Tuning
  - Pipelines
  - Iterative Models
  - Ensemble Models
  - Bayesian Models
