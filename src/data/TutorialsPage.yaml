# This is the title that shows up above the search bar and what's within [] will be printed in purple
# If multiple titles are written then one is chosen randomly in each reload of the website
titles:
  - A pro transitioning to Julia? Try [MLJ for Data Scientists in Two Hours].
  - New to ML? Try [Vectors, Matrices and Data Loading in Julia].
  - Looking for a gentle intro to ML basics? Start with [Loading and Accessing Data].

# This is the placeholder for the search bar
searchText: Search over all tutorials

# This is the hint written below the searchbar. Any markdown string should work.
hint: Looking for a sequential progression of tutorials? See
  [DataScienceTutorials.jl](https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/)

# These are the tutorial tags printed below the hint.
## The navigation file in DataScienceTutorials (or external tutorials) should use only these tags
## If they introduce new tags, then these should be added here and everything will work as expected
# This also controls the order of the tags (and tutorial blocks)
