# 💥 MLJ Website

This is the official repo for the [MLJ website](https://mlj.netlify.app/). The website offers insights into MLJ’s core features and what sets it apart, provides an efficient and organized way to explore models and tutorials, includes the MLJ cheatsheet, showcases related organizations, and offers contributing and general MLJ information along with feedback support.

## ⭐️ Contributing with Tutorials
Would you like your tutorials to be visible on the website for broader reach? Follow these steps:
- Clone the repo or press dot 
- Go to [src/data/ExternalTutorials.yaml](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJ/blob/main/src/data/ExternalTutorials.yaml)
- Specify the tutorial source name, tutorial links, titles and tags and intended learning outcomes
- Voila!

## 🧑🏾‍🔧👨‍🔧 For Maintainers
Each page in the website is represented by a yaml data files in `src/data` and potentially files automatically fetched from MLJ such as:
- The MLJ Model Browser which is generated by downloading the `ModelDescriptors.toml` file from [MLJ.jl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaAI/MLJ.jl/dev/docs/ModelDescriptors.toml) this is used to render the model info in the Models page.
- The MLJ Cheat Sheet which is generated by downloading the cheatsheet markdown file from [MLJ.jl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaAI/MLJ.jl/dev/docs/src/mlj_cheatsheet.md) for the Cheatsheet page.
- The DataScienceTutorials Navigation JSON which is downloaded from [DataScienceTutorials.jl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaAI/DataScienceTutorials.jl/master/_libs/nav/head.js) to be shown in the tutorials page along with other external tutorials.
  
If you change any of these files in their respective repos, then the updates will be reflected in the site in six hours or less unless you choose to trigger the [corresponding Github actions](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJ/actions) manually.

Almost content (eg, text or images) on the website could be modified by updating the corresponding yaml file for the relevant page located in the src/data directory.
```
.
├── Header.yaml                # Navigation Bar Data
├── HomePage.yaml              # Home Page Data
├── TutorialsPage.yaml         # Tutorials Page Data
├── ExternalTutorials.yaml     # Extra Tutorials in tutorials page
├── ModelsPage.yaml            # Models page Data
├── EcosystemPage.yaml         # Ecosystems page Data
├── ContributingPage.md        # Contributing page Data
├── ContributingPage.yaml      # Other Contributing page Data (eg, bucket list)
├── AboutPage.md               # About page Data
├── AboutPage.yaml             # Other About page Data (eg, feedback form)
└── Footer.yaml                # Footer Data
```
For experienced frontend developers willing to contribute to the site itself, check the folders in `src`directory where each page has a folder with Svelte files for the components of the page.

To test your changes you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed then run `npm run dev`. Alternatively, making a PR to `main` should automatically deploy your changes to a temporary view of the website.
